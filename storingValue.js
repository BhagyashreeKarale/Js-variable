// Storing a value into variable
// Example:
// var myLuckyNumber= 3; 

// Here, we stored 3 as a value and it is stored in a variable named myLuckynumber.

// var myResult= 2+3;
// console.log(myResult);
// // output: 5

// Explanation:
// A variable is simply the name of a storage location and variables work like a container to hold the value that we give after equal to (=). = (equal to ) is used to assign a value to a variable, if you do any operation such as addition, multiplication and it will compute first and assign the output to the variable.

// Note:
// we use this console.log(); for printing the output in logs.

// Examples:
// Assign a boolean to a variable isHealthy?
// // please write code here
var isHealthy ;
isHealthy = true
